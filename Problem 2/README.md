#Multivariate Normal (MVN) distribution in JAX

##*Problem Statement: -*
Implement from scratch a sampling method to draw samples from a
multivariate Normal (MVN) Distribution in JAX.

##*Theory: -*

* **Normal Distribution:** Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. In graph form, normal distribution will appear as a bell curve.

* **Multivariate Normal Distribution:** A multivariate normal distribution is a vector in multiple normally distributed variables, such that any linear combination of the variables is also normally distributed. It is mostly useful in extending the central limit theorem to multiple variables, but also has applications to bayesian inference and thus machine learning, where the multivariate normal distribution is used to approximate the features of some characteristics; for instance, in detecting faces in pictures.

##*Implementation: -*

* Used jax, scipy, sklearn
* et-cetra
